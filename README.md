# DBMS Lab

## Task Statement
To complete the work, you need at least 5 interconnected tables filled with data. The peripheral tables must contain at least 4-5 rows each, and the linked tables should have at least 10 rows each.

All data should be entered, viewed, and edited exclusively through user forms.

When entering or editing data, you must ensure the correctness (format) of the input. For example, if a user tries to enter text into a numeric or date field, such an action should be blocked with a corresponding message from your system, not from the underlying DBMS. Another option is to prevent the entry of incorrect data into any indicative field on the form. In this case, you need to provide prompts on the form (either permanent or appearing when necessary) about the desired input format.

Upon opening the database, the main form-menu should be displayed, which contains links to all other forms, queries, input, editing, and viewing options. All other forms must include a button to return to the main menu.
